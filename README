dwmstatus
Fork of the original dwmstatus ( https://git.suckless.org/dwmstatus/ ) status
monitor. It renames root X window, then dwm reads its name and prints it in
their status bar.

By default it outputs something like this:

 36°C | - 69.9 5.12 W | 7 121221 162733+0300 

It means:

• CPU temperature in °C (it searches for hwmon directory in provided by
config path /sys/devices/platform/<modulename>, /sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0
by default, then it opens first finded hwmon<num> folder and then checks
provided sensor file)

• battery status ('-' is discharging, '+' is charging, '?' is unknown), current
charge (relative to designed capacity, not last full capacity a.k.a. 'degraded'
capacity) in percents, current power consumption in watts.

• day of week, day of month + month + year, hours + minutes + seconds + timezone


dwmstatus updates time each second and each two seconds all other stuff.
It also autocorrects timeouts to update exactly when a new second begins.
