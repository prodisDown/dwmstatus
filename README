dwmstatus
=========

Fork of the original dwmstatus ( https://git.suckless.org/dwmstatus/ ) status bar.
It outputs its data by renaming root X window, which dwm then prints in its own bar.

It output looks something like that (but you can change it, of course):

	 wlan0: 192.168.0.115 (0.0 b/42.0K) | 36Â°C | - 69.9 5.12 | 6 121122 100000+0300 

In its default configuration it can do this list of things.
* Monitors specific network interface, outputs IP(v4) assigned to it, and counts average
 rate of bytes (rx/tx) send through this interface.
* CPU temperature in degree Celsius.
* Battery status (`-` is discharging, `+` is charging, `?` is anything else),
 its current capacity (in percentage from full designed capacity, thus it'l never be 100),
 and current power draw in watts.
* Calendar day-of-week, date (ddmmyy) and current time (HHMMSS) with timezone offset.

You are welcome to read, explore, edit and copy/fork this code. It was designed to be edited when
 you want to change something or add new functionality just by reading sources and
 editing config.h file.
